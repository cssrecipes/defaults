/*
 * Some defaults are based on inherit
 *
 * Why inherit ?
 * If you have a component and his children not using border-box for example:
 *
 * Without inherit you might need
 * .Component, .Component * { box-sizing: content-box }
 *
 * With inherit you can just write
 * .Component { box-sizing: content-box }
